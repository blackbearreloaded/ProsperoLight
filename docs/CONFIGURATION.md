# Application configuration and versioning

[`sce_sys/param.json`](../sce_sys/param.json) is the single source of truth for
application identity, Shell metadata, and release versioning. The build
validates it and copies it unchanged into `dist/<TITLE_ID>/sce_sys/param.json`.
There is no second project manifest to keep synchronized.

## Identity and metadata

Change these fields together when creating a new application:

| `param.json` field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `localizedParameters.<language>.titleName` | Name displayed by the Shell. |
| `titleId` | Unique `PPSA` plus five-digit application identifier. |
| `conceptId` | Five numeric characters; normally the numeric title-ID portion. |
| `contentId` | Package identity containing the title ID and a 16-character suffix. |
| `contentVersion` | Application and repository release version in `NN.NNN.NNN` form. |
| `masterVersion` | Compatible release baseline in `NN.NN` form. |
| `downloadDataSize` | Reservation that makes `/download0` available. |

Keep `titleId`, `conceptId`, and `contentId` stable for updates to one installed
application. Use a new identity only when the result should be a separate title.

The supported initializer coordinates those values and the displayed name:

```bash
make init TITLE_ID=PPSA12345 APP_NAME="My Native App"
make init TITLE_ID=PPSA12346 APP_NAME="My Media App" APP_CATEGORY=media
```

It derives the 16-character content suffix from the app name unless
`CONTENT_SUFFIX` is supplied. It does not change `contentVersion`,
`masterVersion`, storage sizing, or unrelated metadata.

## One version everywhere

This project does not use Semantic Versioning. `contentVersion` is the only
release number and must use the PS5 `NN.NNN.NNN` format, for example
`01.002.003`. Use that exact value for the Git tag and GitHub Release name—do
not add a `v` prefix:

```bash
git tag 01.002.003
git push origin 01.002.003
```

The release workflow rejects a tag that differs from
`sce_sys/param.json`'s `contentVersion`. For ordinary development, keep
`masterVersion` at `01.00` and increment `contentVersion` for each release.
Change `masterVersion` only when intentionally changing the compatible release
baseline.

The loader-visible SDK and FSELF constants are internal build-format values,
not application versions. They remain fixed to the cross-firmware-validated
profile in `tools/build.sh`.

## Game and media categories

Category is represented directly by standard `param.json` fields:

| Area | `applicationCategoryType` | `contentBadgeType` | `gameIntent` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Games | `0` | `1` | Permit `launchActivity`. |
| Media | `65536` | `2` | Remove the field. |

The build validates these combinations but does not rewrite them. Category does
not grant codec, filesystem, network, background-execution, or other
entitlements.

## Source and runtime conventions

Every `.c`, `.cc`, and `.cpp` file below `src/` is compiled automatically.
Move experiments outside `src/` when they should not enter the build. C++20 is
the default; C files use C11. Exceptions and RTTI remain disabled.

The generated `runtime/libc.prx` is always included and verified against
`runtime/libc.prx.sha256`. Additional local PRXs may be placed under the ignored
`.local/runtime/` directory and selected with `APP_RUNTIME_MODULES`; the build
copies pre-signed modules and wraps raw ELF modules. Duplicate filenames are
rejected.

Packaged read-only data belongs under `assets/` and appears at `/app0/assets/`.

## Optional build inputs

Build-only choices use Make variables rather than application metadata:

| Variable | Space-separated values |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_DEFINITIONS` | Preprocessor definitions such as `FEATURE_AUDIO=1`. |
| `APP_INCLUDE_PATHS` | Repository-relative include directories. |
| `APP_STATIC_ARCHIVES` | Repository-relative `.a` files in linker order. |
| `APP_RUNTIME_MODULES` | PRX paths below the ignored `.local/runtime/` directory. |
| `PACBREW_PACKAGES` | PacBrew `pkg-config` module names. |
| `PACBREW_INCLUDE_PATHS` | Paths below PacBrew's `/user/homebrew`. |
| `PACBREW_STATIC_ARCHIVES` | PacBrew `.a` paths below `/user/homebrew`. |

For example:

```bash
make PACBREW_PACKAGES="sdl2 openssl" \
  APP_DEFINITIONS="FEATURE_AUDIO=1" \
  APP_INCLUDE_PATHS="include"
```

Set the same environment variables before `./build.ps1` on Windows. Paths in
these lists cannot contain spaces. See [PacBrew dependencies](PACBREW.md) for
manual archive examples.

Deployment uses a separate set of Make variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PS5_HOST` | required | Console IPv4 address or hostname. |
| `FTP_PORT` | `2121` | FTP service port. |
| `DEPLOY_FORMAT` | `folder` | `folder`, `ffpfsc`, or `ffpkg` output. |
| `PS5_FTP_USER` | `anonymous` | FTP username. |
| `PS5_FTP_PASSWORD` | `codex` | FTP password. |
| `DEPLOY_DRY_RUN` | `0` | Build without networking when set to `1`. |

These values affect only `make deploy`; they are not application metadata and
are never copied into the built title. See [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md).

Frequently used local build and deployment values may be kept in an ignored
hidden file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The file uses ordinary GNU Make `NAME=value` syntax. Do not put title identity
or release versions there: `param.json` remains the single source of truth for
the application. Do not commit credentials; `.env` is ignored by Git.

## Persistent configuration

Files live under `/data/prosperolight` after filesystem elevation, with
`/download0` as the sandbox fallback. Configuration version 8 migrates both
the upstream and PyroWave version 7 layouts, preserving saved hosts and ports. Write a
temporary file and rename it into place to avoid partial writes. Provide an
application-level export/import mechanism for important data because retention
after title deletion or cache-management actions is not guaranteed.

Native SaveData initialization is not part of this baseline; see
[Platform findings](PLATFORM_NOTES.md).

The packaged `lapy.elf` is built from the pinned upstream Lapy revision for
title `PPSA99002`. A resident service remains compatible, but is optional.

### Settings list navigation

The settings page scrolls vertically as the selected row moves out of view. Use
Up / Down to select a setting and Cross to change it. The scrollbar shows your
position; stream shortcuts and the footer stay visible outside the list.

### Custom server port

Use **Add PC** and enter `IPv4:HTTP-port`, for example `192.168.1.5:48000`.
This is the HTTP port (47989 by default), not the browser administration port.
The selected PC's address always shows its port. Automatic discovery retains
explicitly saved endpoints; the port is not a global streaming setting.

### Frame pacing and VSync

| Policy | Scheduling | VSync preference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unpaced | Submit the newest ready frame without a cadence timer. | On synchronizes flips; Off requests immediate output. |
| Paced | Learn source cadence, retain a bounded readiness reserve, and align fixed-VSync submissions using observed flip timing. | On/Off is retained independently. |
| Paced + VRR | Use source-clock pacing and request variable-rate VideoOut; API failure uses fixed-output pacing. | Synchronized flips are required; the saved preference is restored when another policy is selected. |

VRR is a request, not proof that the display accepted it. A rejected request
falls back to fixed output and is recorded in the session log. Native
immediate flips can also fall back to VSync if the system rejects them.
The launcher requests fixed 60 Hz when its own VideoOut handle opens.

Menu sounds and the presentation policy are stored separately from the paired
host configuration in `prosperolight-ui-sound.bin` and
`prosperolight-presentation.bin` beside the main configuration
(`/data/prosperolight/config`, or `/download0` in the sandbox).

The list holds settings only; the panel beside it shows the six Touchpad
shortcuts, including the two that send the host's Back and Guide buttons.

Current hardware evidence: H.264 4K60 completed Unpaced, Paced, and
Paced + VRR selected-policy sessions with zero decoded frames discarded
before presentation. Those measurements preceded the VRR initialization-order
fix and do not establish active VRR. Confirmation after that fix, PyroWave
pacing comparisons, and HEVC HDR regression checks are pending. H.264 4K120
recorded decoder timing spikes and input-queue overflows even with Unpaced;
these limits must not be represented as eliminated by pacing.

### Frame rate and bitrate

Frame rate is one of 60, 90 or 120 FPS and bitrate is a slider from 10 to 300 Mbps
(to 1000 Mbps while PyroWave is selected), as in 01.000.080. A settings file may hold
any target from 30 to 120 FPS; the row then shows the preset at or below it.

### Diagnostic logs

`Diagnostic logs` turns the stream's diagnostic lines and the end-of-stream performance
exports on or off. It defaults to On and is stored beside the main configuration as
`prosperolight-logging.bin`. The stream's reports stop at once; the rest of the log
follows the switch from the next start.

Every line goes to `prosperolight-launcher.log`, tagged `[session]` or `[menu-output]`.
The log of the previous launch is kept as `prosperolight-launcher.prev.log`, and a log
that passes 8 MiB within one launch starts again.

### Source-clock frame pacing

Unpaced keeps the latest-frame policy without an extra software wait. Paced and Paced+VRR share a source-clock controller, learn the source interval from validated RTP timestamps (presentation timestamps are the fallback), and carry a small bounded readiness reserve (up to the smaller of 10 ms or one source interval). The ready queue holds at most two decoded native images. Old decoded images are discarded only when a decoded successor exists; compressed H.264/HEVC references are preserved.

Native fixed-VSync pacing uses completed-flip observations as a best-effort phase estimate and submits with a preparation margin. These observations are not a precise scanout clock. VRR API failure uses the fixed-output timing policy. The HUD distinguishes successful VRR API activation from fixed fallback; API success does not prove physical panel VRR.

PyroWave submits GPU decode/render immediately, waits for preparation completion, then paces presentation. Its two-entry compressed queue preserves brief arrival bursts; it does not claim two prepared GPU surfaces or asynchronous decode/present overlap. GPU fences measure work completion, not physical display completion. Independent stale compressed PyroWave frames may be skipped, while the sole remaining frame is retained.

Per-stream pacing summaries report learned period, reserve, missed readiness targets, re-anchors, wake lateness and submission-spacing error. These counters remain controlled by Diagnostic logs. Compare completed-flip intervals and end-to-end latency, not only submission spacing, during console validation.

The upstream OpenGL launcher log additionally retains the current and previous
launch, bounded by a periodic flush/size check. Disabling logging redirects
stdout/stderr to `/dev/null`; crash reports remain available independently.

### Quit host app after stream

`Quit host app after stream` is off by default. On sends the authenticated
Sunshine cancel request when leaving the stream, stopping the host game/app.
Off keeps the host app running for resume. ProsperoLight stays open in both
cases. Initial setup failures do not trigger this optional cancel request.
The setting persists in `config/prosperolight-host-quit.bin` (PLQ1 + boolean).
The removed local app close setting is not reused.
