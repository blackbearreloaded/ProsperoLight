## Native build dependencies

The application build uses LLVM/Clang/lld, zlib 1.3.2, and the public
[PS5 payload SDK](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/sdk). The bootstrapper
downloads SDK v0.42 after verifying SHA-256
`8cfbc7cd5811e719eb4f0c47eea668d3dc7b40bc8ab11c4a5031d40c23ec02da`.
It downloads zlib 1.3.2 from the upstream source archive after verifying
SHA-256 `bb329a0a2cd0274d05519d61c667c062e06990d72e125ee2dfa8de64f0119d16`
and compiles its static archive locally. Both dependencies remain under ignored
`.deps/native/`, retain their upstream licenses, and are not distributed by
this repository. No Sony SDK file is included.

Target C++ compilation uses the LLVM libc++ headers distributed by the public
SDK. Those headers retain the Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception license recorded
upstream. The application statically links only the required portions of the
corresponding libc++ and libc++abi archives; it does not dynamically load the
complete archives.

The PS5 ELF converter and FSELF writer in `tooling/native/` are derived from
[SharpProspero](https://github.com/SvenGDK/SharpProspero), Copyright (C) 2026
SvenGDK, GPL-3.0, and were translated to C++ and modified by BlackBearReloaded.

## Host test dependency

The host unit-test target downloads
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) 1.17.0 after verifying
SHA-256 `65fab701d9829d38cb77c14acdc431d2108bfdbf8979e40eb8ae567edf10b27c`.
It remains under ignored `.deps/test/`, retains its BSD-3-Clause license, and
is not linked into any PS5 application, runtime, or package artifact.

## Optional PacBrew dependencies

When selected through `PACBREW_*` build variables, the build downloads the prebuilt ports image
from [ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo](https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo)
release `v0.40.2`, verifies its published SHA-256, and extracts only the
`target/user/homebrew` prefix under ignored `.deps/pacbrew/`. It does not
replace the pinned SDK or install files globally. PacBrew recipes and every
linked third-party library retain their upstream licenses; applications must
review those terms before redistribution.

## Optional UFS2Tool dependency

When `.ffpkg` output is requested, the platform bootstrapper fetches
[SvenGDK/UFS2Tool](https://github.com/SvenGDK/UFS2Tool) at commit
`b5307a60d5b4e3a68ba680e0e33cfadf05017c77` into the ignored
`.deps/UFS2Tool` cache and builds it with the host .NET SDK. UFS2Tool is
BSD-2-Clause software and is not distributed by this repository.

## Optional MkPFS dependency

When `.ffpfsc` output is requested, the platform bootstrapper fetches
[PSBrew/MkPFS](https://github.com/PSBrew/MkPFS) at commit
`6cb8313dfe0c988ac52617794553f343243d3a56` into the ignored `.deps/MkPFS`
cache and installs its Python dependencies into an ignored virtual environment
there. MkPFS and its dependencies retain their own licenses and are not
distributed by this repository.

## Independently authored runtime shim

`tooling/native/libc_builder.cpp` and the manifests under
`tooling/native/runtime/` are independently authored for this project and
licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The generated `runtime/libc.prx` contains
project-authored compatibility stubs, startup code, and semantic loader
metadata. It contains no Sony runtime implementation.

Original ps5-native-app-boilerplate code is Copyright (C) 2026
BlackBearReloaded and licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later. Source and script files
carry matching SPDX identifiers.

## Original presentation assets

The BlackBear icon, selection artwork, and default selection track
`sce_sys/snd0.at9` are original assets supplied by BlackBearReloaded, Copyright
(C) 2026 BlackBearReloaded, and distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later. The track
is titled `Night Drive`.

No proprietary runtime module, encryption key, or game file is included.

## ProsperoLight streaming dependencies

The streaming protocol and decoder integration use pinned source revisions of
[moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c),
[mbedTLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls), and
[Opus](https://github.com/xiph/opus). Their licenses are retained in the
corresponding `third_party/` source trees. None of these dependencies is
claimed to be project-authored.

## Launcher

The launcher is drawn with OpenGL through the
[ps5-opengl](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ps5-opengl) SDK 1.0.0
(GPL-3.0-or-later), which the build downloads after verifying SHA-256
`f93643c04c843d56143b00951df1f8042ea7706ae9f19e4e9abf158e1ead77c5` and links
statically. The SDK contains Mesa 26.2.0 (primarily MIT, with file-specific
licences), OpenGNM and OpenGNM PSBC (MIT), SPIRV-Headers and Vulkan-Headers;
its own `LICENSE`, `LICENSES/` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` are unpacked beside
it under ignored `.deps/ps5-opengl/` and are not distributed by this
repository. `src/runtime/app_heap.c` and `src/runtime/runtime_shims.c` are
adapted from that SDK's native application recipe.

`third_party/ps5-homebrew-ui/` is the UI kit the launcher's widgets come from:
ps5-homebrew-ui, Copyright (C) 2026 BlackBearReloaded, GPL-3.0-or-later. Its
shader distance functions follow Inigo Quilez's published formulas (MIT).

The launcher's fonts in `assets/fonts/` are distance-field renderings, made
by `tools/bake-fonts.sh`, of the typefaces in `third_party/fonts/`: Inter and
Montserrat (SIL Open Font License 1.1) and DejaVu Sans Mono (Bitstream Vera
licence). Their licence texts are kept beside both. The baker and the PC
harness use `stb_truetype.h` and `stb_image_write.h` from
[stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) (public domain or MIT); neither is part
of the application.

The launcher's sounds in `assets/audio/sfx/glass/` are original recordings by
BlackBearReloaded, generated with ElevenLabs Sound Effects, Copyright (C) 2026
BlackBearReloaded, and distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later.

The small sources in `vendor/ps5/sdk/stubs/` are linker-only import
descriptions for public PS5 system modules missing from the bundled SDK stub
set. They are compiled during the host build, are not packaged, and do not
contain a Sony implementation.
